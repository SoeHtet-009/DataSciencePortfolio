## Projects
#### Tweets Topic Modeling + Recommendation Engine Using NetworkX
- Utilized a pre-trained BERT model to conduct topic modeling on a vast repository of tweets, enabling the extraction of users' topic interests from unstructured data. Following the topic modeling phase, a network graph-based recommendation system was developed using Twitter user networks characterized by shared interests. This system facilitates friend recommendations and topic recommendations to twitter users prioritizing connections based on the strength of their ties within the network.

#### Hotel Cancellation Prediction
- Designed and implemented machine learning models capable of predicting hotel booking cancellations, enabling optimized room allocation and precise management of overbooking percentages.

#### Frequent Pattern Mining of Hotel Guests
- Analysis of frequent co-occurring behaviors among hotel guests, revealing distinctive traits and preferences of loyal customers, which can enhance customer retention strategies.

#### NLP Sentiment Analysis
- Conducted a comprehensive NLP analysis of online shopping reviews, identifying common themes within positive and negative feedback. Additionally, developed a sentiment analysis model to quantify sentiment in the reviews.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Simple data visualizations related to the performance of teams in the English Premier League, providing insights into championship victories and relegations over time.
